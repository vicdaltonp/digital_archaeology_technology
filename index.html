<p>Currently, society is in a state of unprecedented technological advancement. As a result, archaeology has been faced with new technologies and technique that have transformed the discipline.</p> 
      
      <p>In UVic's Anthropology 485 curriculum, four components of Digital Archaeology were explored:</p>
      
      <ul><li>Web Platforms</li>
        <li>Vision and Visualisation</li>
        <li>Digital Materiality and Space</li>
        <li>Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality</li></ul>
      
      <p>Each of these sections focus on a number of technologies that have been implemented in Digital Archaeology. By using these topics as examples, one can begin to explore the current state of technology in Digital Archaeology.

      <h4>Web Platforms</h4>
      
      <p> Web Platforms are an increasingly prominent way in which Digital Archaeology is developing.</p>
      
      <h4>Vision and Visualisation</h4>
      
      <p>Vision and Visualisation have been an important part of archaeology, and it has increasingly been a driving force of Digital Archaeology.</p>
        
      <h4>Digital Materiality and Space</h4>
      
      <p>Organizing data is an important part of archaeology, resulting in Digital Archaeology's exploration into the realm of Digital Materiality and Space.</p>
        
      <h4>Augmented Reality and Visual Materiality</h4>
      
      <p>Arguably the most forward-looking component of Digital Archaeology, Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality has much potential for the future of this developing discipline.</p>
