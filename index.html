<p>Currently, society is in a state of unprecedented technological advancement. As a result, archaeology has been faced with new technologies and technique that have transformed the discipline.</p> 
      
      <p>In UVic's Anthropology 485 curriculum, four components of Digital Archaeology were explored:</p>
      
      <ul><li>Web Platforms</li>
        <li>Vision and Visualisation</li>
        <li>Digital Materiality and Space</li>
        <li>Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality</li></ul>
      
      <p>Each of these sections focus on a number of technologies that have been implemented in Digital Archaeology. By using these topics as examples, one can begin to explore the current state of technology in Digital Archaeology.

          <h4>Web Platforms</h4>
      
      <p>Web platforms are an increasingly prominent way in which Digital Archaeology is developing. From presenting research and information on websites to raising awareness through social media campaigns, web platforms are being implemented in a variety of ways. Museums and heritage sites, along with archaeological research sites and projects, have increasingly taken-up building websites to display different types of information. Craigdarroch Castle, for instance, has a very well developed website detailing various components of the site to inform visitors. Similarly, on sites like Twitter the Catalhoyuk research project has developed an in-depth and informative social media campaign to raise awareness and generate interest in the site.</p>
      
      <p>While many people see the use of web platforms as a positive direction for archaeology to take, since it brings important issues into the public's focus, there are others who see it as a less-than-great development. An article in <i>The Guardian</i><sup>1</sup>, for instance, promoted the idea that "serious" academic studies should be done without a dependence on social media platforms like Instagram that seem more casual than academic. A converse perspective, which is adequately summarized by an article in <i>Forbes</i><sup>2</sup>, notes the benefits social media can provide to supplement one's research. In essence, there is merit to both arguments: social media can seem to distract from the academic-dimensions of archaeology, but it can also be helpful for promoting research. This question will be tackled further in <i>The Questions</i> section above.</p>
      
          <h4>Vision and Visualisation</h4>
      
      <p>Vision and Visualisation have been an important part of archaeology, and it has increasingly been a driving force of Digital Archaeology.</p>
        
          <h4>Digital Materiality and Space</h4>
      
      <p>Organizing data is an important part of archaeology, resulting in Digital Archaeology's exploration into the realm of Digital Materiality and Space.</p>
        
          <h4>Augmented Reality and Visual Materiality</h4>
      
      <p>Arguably the most forward-looking component of Digital Archaeology, Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality has much potential for the future of this developing discipline.</p>
