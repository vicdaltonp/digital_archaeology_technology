<p>Currently, society is in a state of unprecedented technological advancement. As a result, archaeology has been faced with new technologies and technique that have transformed the discipline.</p> 
      
      <p>In UVic's Anthropology 485 curriculum, four components of Digital Archaeology were explored:</p>
      
      <ul><li>Web Platforms</li>
        <li>Vision and Visualisation</li>
        <li>Digital Materiality and Space</li>
        <li>Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality</li></ul>
      
      <p>Each of these sections focus on a number of technologies that have been implemented in Digital Archaeology. By using these topics as examples, one can begin to explore the current state of technology in Digital Archaeology. Additionally, to learn a bit more about these various topics, see <i>Public Archaeology in Victoria, BC</i>. The reflections on this blog explore the topics below within the context of Public Archaeology and can offer an idea of how these topics can be explored within an archaeological context.

          <h4>Web Platforms</h4>
      
      <p>Web platforms are an increasingly prominent way in which Digital Archaeology is developing. From presenting research and information on websites to raising awareness through social media campaigns, web platforms are being implemented in a variety of ways. Museums and heritage sites, along with archaeological research sites and projects, have increasingly taken-up building websites to display different types of information. Craigdarroch Castle, for instance, has a very well developed website detailing various components of the site to inform visitors. Similarly, on sites like Twitter the Catalhoyuk research project has developed an in-depth and informative social media campaign to raise awareness and generate interest in the site.</p>
      
      <p>While many people see the use of web platforms as a positive direction for archaeology to take, since it brings important issues into the public's focus, there are others who see it as a less-than-great development. An article in <i>The Guardian</i><sup>1</sup>, for instance, promoted the idea that "serious" academic studies should be done without a dependence on social media platforms like Instagram that seem more casual than academic. A converse perspective, which is adequately summarized by an article in <i>Forbes</i><sup>2</sup>, notes the benefits social media can provide to supplement one's research. In essence, there is merit to both arguments: social media can seem to distract from the academic-dimensions of archaeology, but it can also be helpful for promoting research. This question will be tackled further in <i>The Questions</i> section above.</p>
      
          <h4>Vision and Visualisation</h4>
      
      <p>Visualisation have been an important part of archaeology, and it has been a driving force of Digital Archaeology. Increasingly, there are programs being developed that offer unique and innovative ways to present archaeological data. <i>Voyant</i>, for instance, allows for multiple articles or websites to be broken down by common-words in a simple and efficient way. While this cannot replace actual in-depth research, it nonetheless offers a clear and concise idea of what one can look for in the sources. From infographics to timelines, there are numerous ways for archaeologists to present their research.</p>
      
      <p>Just as visualisation can be used to present information, it can also be used to do actual research. For example, <i>Twarc</i> and sonification can allow archaeologists to do research and look at their findings in new, less-traditional ways. Gaining different perspectives through these innovative sites enables archaeologists to think about their research in new ways. One of the main changes Digital Archaeology has created for archaeologists is allowing them to approach research and interpret results in new ways, and visualisation plays a key role in this process.</p>
          
           <h4>Digital Materiality and Space</h4>
      
      <p>In recent years, materiality and space have been a key issue in Digital Archaeology. Taking data and presenting it in new ways, as demonstrated by the visualisation techniques above, can be a great way to explore archaeology. With materiality and space, however, visualisation seemingly takes a step further and creates a different experience using the data or implements it in new ways. For instance, interactive maps allow data to be understood and explored in ways that engage with users. Similarly, audio guides contribute to a different atmosphere in which listeners can experience archaeology. In effect, these types of technologies allow archaeologists to transform their data and create a new type of space in which the information can be understood.</p>
      
      <p>Another key development in archaeology that has been fundamental to Digital Archaeology is the creation of digital exhibits and apps. These types of technologies allow archaeologists to present their findings to a broad audience in unique ways. Exhibits like "The Harbinson Collection" on the <i>History Museum of Canada</i> website demonstrates how digital space can be used to create an exhibit that can effectively be explored by anyone with access to a computer. Not only does this present the information in a concise way, but it also allows for a degree of preservation for artifacts and sites, whic can be put in jeopardy when exhibits are in-person and thus open to destruction, either intentional or just wear over time. Likewise, heritage apps are increasingly leading towards a close connection between the digital world and the real world, which will be explored in greater depth in the next topic.
        
          <h4>Augmented Reality and Visual Materiality</h4>
      
      <p>Arguably the most forward-looking component of Digital Archaeology, Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality has much potential for the future of this developing discipline.</p>
