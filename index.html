<p>Currently, society is in a state of unprecedented technological advancement. As a result, archaeology has been faced with new technologies and techniques that have transformed the discipline.</p> 
      
      <p>To get at the issue of technology, it is useful to establish some categories of Digital Archaeology through which technology can be explored. In UVic's Anthropology 485 curriculum, four components of Digital Archaeology are effectively defined:</p>
      
      <ul><li>Web Platforms</li>
        <li>Vision and Visualisation</li>
        <li>Digital Materiality and Space</li>
        <li>Augemented Reality and Visual Materiality</li></ul>
      
      <p>Each of these sections focus on a number of technologies and techniques that have been implemented in Digital Archaeology. By using these topics as examples, one can begin to explore the current state of technology in Digital Archaeology and see how it appears to be diverging from traditional archaeology in certain ways.</p>

          <h4>Web Platforms</h4>
      
      <p>Web platforms are an increasingly prominent way in which Digital Archaeology is developing. From presenting research and information on websites to raising awareness through social media campaigns, web platforms are being implemented in a variety of ways. Museums and heritage sites, along with archaeological research sites and projects, are increasingly building websites to display different types of information. Craigdarroch Castle, for instance, has a very well developed website detailing various components of the site to inform visitors. Similarly, on sites like Twitter, the Catalhoyuk research project has developed an in-depth and informative social media campaign to raise awareness and generate interest in the site.</p>
      
      <p>While many people see the use of web platforms as a positive direction for archaeology to take, since it brings important issues into the public's focus, there are others who see it as a less-than-great development. An article in <i>The Guardian</i><sup>1</sup>, for instance, promoted the idea that "serious" academic studies should be done without a dependence on social media platforms like Instagram, which seems more casual than academic. A converse perspective, which is adequately summarized by an article in <i>Forbes</i><sup>2</sup>, notes the benefits social media can provide to support one's research. In essence, there is merit to both arguments: social media can seem to distract from the academic-dimensions of archaeology, but it can also be helpful for promoting research. This issue will be tackled further in <i>The Questions</i> through the consideration of integrity and entertainment in archaeology.</p>
      
          <h4>Vision and Visualisation</h4>
      
      <p>Visualisation has been an important part of archaeology, and it has consequently been a driving force of Digital Archaeology. Increasingly, there are programs being developed that offer unique and innovative ways to present archaeological data. <i>Voyant</i>, for instance, allows for multiple articles or websites to be broken down by common-words in a simple and efficient way. While this cannot replace formal research, it nonetheless offers a clear and concise idea of what one can look for in sources in a quick and effective way. Moreover, from infographics to timelines, there are numerous ways for archaeologists to present their research in ways that allow them to engage with the material and also allow viewers to engage with it as well.</p>
      
      <p>Just as visualisation can be used to present information, it can also be used to conduct research. For example, <i>Twarc</i> and sonification can allow archaeologists to do research and look at their findings in new, less-traditional ways. Gaining different perspectives through these innovative sites enables archaeologists to think about their research differently. One of the main changes Digital Archaeology has created for archaeologists is allowing them to approach research and interpret results in new ways, and visualisation plays a clear role in this process.</p>
          
           <h4>Digital Materiality and Space</h4>
      
      <p>In recent years, materiality and space have been a key issue in Digital Archaeology. Taking data and presenting it in new ways can be a great way to explore archaeology, as seen with the visualisation techniques above. With materiality and space, however, visualisation is taken a step further to create an altogether different experience using the data. For instance, interactive maps allow data to be understood and explored in ways that engage users. Similarly, audio guides create an atmosphere in which listeners can experience archaeology in new ways. In effect, these types of technologies allow archaeologists to transform their data and create a new type of space in which the information can be understood.</p>
      
      <p>Another fundamental development of Digital Archaeology is the creation of digital exhibits and apps. These types of technologies allow archaeologists to present their findings to a broad audience. Exhibits like "The Harbinson Collection" on the <i>History Museum of Canada</i> website demonstrates how digital space can be used to create an exhibit that can be easily explored by anyone with access to a computer. This does not only present the information in a concise way, but allows for a degree of preservation for artifacts and sites, which can be put in jeopardy at in-person exhibits that have the potential to be damaged. Likewise, heritage apps are increasingly leading to a close connection between the digital world and the real world, which will be explored in greater depth in the topic below.
        
          <h4>Augmented Reality and Visual Materiality</h4>
      
      <p>Arguably the most forward-looking component of Digital Archaeology, augemented reality and visual materiality have much potential for the future of archaeology. Narrative based games and maps, like <i>Twine</i> and <i>7Scenes</i>, create opportunities for archaeologists and the public to understand and explore archaeology. At this point in time, virtual and augmented reality narratives are still fairly basic, yet it is quite possible that the technology will continue to develop, especially considering how quickly technology has developed over the last few decades. Nonetheless, virtual and augmented reality is an interesting component of Digital Archaeology, and, many argue, its most promising feature moving forward.</p>
      
      <p>Just as virtual and augmented reality can lead to a more immersive experience in archaeology, so too can visual materiality. Recently, 3D modelling has emerged as a popular example in Digital Archaeology for two reasons. Firstly, 3D models on the computer can bring artifacts to life instead of keeping them in a merely two-dimensional state. Secondly, 3D modellling can be used for preservation, since models can be used in lieu of actual artifacts, thus protecting the originals and allowing replicas to be shared with a larger audience. Moreover, like visualisation and digital materiality, virtual reality and visual materiality offer an interesting glimpse into the possible future of Digital Archaeology.</p>
       
      
      <h3>Technology in the Future</h3>
        
        <p>As seen above, Digital Archaeology uses technology in a number of ways; however, it is still unclear what the future may hold. While no one can know for sure, there a number of predictions that can likely be made with a certain degree of accuracy.</p>
      
        <p>There are a few common trends in the aforementioned topics that will likely continue into the future. Firstly, it is clear that visualisation plays a key role in Digital Archaeology. As more user-friendly and innovative types of data visualisation are inevitably designed, it is very likely that archaeologists will adopt these technologies where applicable. Furthermore, visualisation may, over time, become more seamless with archaeological research and data, thus allowing for Digital Archaeology to further develop as its own, unique discipline.</p>
      
        <p>Secondly, technology can aid in archaeologists' interpretation of data. Already, programs like <i>Twarc</i> are creating new ways for archaeologists to view and understand data. As technology becomes better suited to dealing with large amounts of data, processing programs will become increasingly important for archaeologists.</p>
          
        <p>Thirdly, the above topics demonstrate how various types of technologies can be used for preservation strategies. Whether this involves building digital exhibits or creating 3D models, technology at this point in time is becoming increasingly useful for preservation. Moreover, it is safe to assume that as technological advances take place and Digital Archaeology continues to explore aspects of preservation, it is quite possible that there will be new and improved ways for artifacts, sites, and other data to be protected. This emphasis on preservation as it exists now and may develop in the future is explored further in <i>The Method and Theory</i> section listed above.</p>
      
        <p>Clearly visualisation, interpretation, and preservation will likely continue to be important issues in Digital Archaeology and key areas in which technology plays a significant role. As will be seen in <i>The Method and Theory</i>, changes as a result of technology have led to profound shifts in how digital archaeologists approach their work. While one cannot know exactly what types of technological innovations and changes will occur, it is clear that these characteristics of Digital Archaeology will continue to play a key role.</p>
